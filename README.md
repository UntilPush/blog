I've excerpted dialogue form _the Big Short_ as my homework of interpret.

Where I design 3 roles in this dialogue:

1. B of hedge fund (__B__ for short)
2. Product manager 1 of hedge fund(__A__ for short)
3. Product manager of bank (__C_ for short)

I believe that it's proper to set 4 roles in this dialogue.
Designing B of hedge fund and product manager of bank



C: What is your basic mortgage bond? They were just thousands of AAA-mortgages bundled together,guaranteed by the US-government.
The modern ones r different.They r private.And they r made up of layers of tranches.Highest level AAA's getting paid first.The lowest rated B's getting paid last,taking on defaults first.
Obviously,if u r buying B's you could make more money with risky.Sometimes they couldn't repay.
I'm talking rock-bottom Fico-scores.
No income-verification.Adjustable rates.CDOs

With something called a credit default swap.
It's like insurance on the bond,and if it goes bust,u can make 10-to-1.
Even 20-to-1 return,and it's already slowly going bust.

No one is paying attention.Because the banks r too busy getting paid obscens fees to sell these bonds.

A:Wait.U work for the bank,I bet ur margins r pretty nice.

C:Mind ur business. Let's not talk about my margins.
I work for bankÔºÅI didn't sell my brain to bank.
Big bank,small bank..I work for money.
I'm standing in front of a burning house,and I'm offering u fire insurance on it.

A:How can these underlying bonds be as bad as u say?

C:It wouldn't be legal!Nobody knows what'in them!
U think we just warehouse it on the books?No,we just repackage it,with a bunch of other shit that didn't sell.
and put it into a CDO

A:A CDO?

C:YES

A:What is it ?

C:CDO,Collateralized Debt Obligations
Where we take a bunch of B's BB's and BBB's that haven't sold.
And we bundle them in a pile.When the pile gets large enough,the whole is suddenly considered 'Diversified'
Then,the rating agency give it AAA-rating.

A:So mortgage bonds r dogshit?The CDOs r dogshit wrapped in caateshit?
Institutions treat these CDOs like they r as solid treasury bonds.

C:Yeah.Let's make a deal.We could work out a pay-as-we-go structure that would payout if the bonds fail.
It would also apply to your payments if the value of the mortgage-fund goes up
You hava to pay us mouthly premiums.
Do u agree it?

A:Fine.We will take 130 million Garabaldi-4 BBB credit swap.

C:Sharpen ur pencils,I'll get the paperwork ready.


A:B,I have put out sth really interesting.

B:Great! Whenever u find sth interesting,we all sit to make money.
What stock r u vowing?

A:No,no,no,I want to short the housing market.

B:really? but the housing market is rock-solid!
_Fed_ just said : "Bubbles r regional,defults r rare!"

A:Look!He is wrong.

B:Look,I don't think u mean to do this,but sometimes u sound very dismissive and superior.

A: It's a fact,He is wrong.

B:u r a great product manager.Why don't u just stick with stocks?

A:u know me,I look for value,wherever it can be found.In fact,these mortgage backed securities r filled with extremely risky sub-prime adjustable rates.Once the majority of these adjustable rate kick in 2007.The American housing market is over.

B:OK,just calm down!How much in total?

A:130 million.

B:That's pretty much all of our fund liquidity!
That's highly distressing!

A:Well.I'm not certain that u really understand this trade.
I have full autonomy when it comes to investment strategy.
u can read our agreement.

B:Do not throw our acception-agreement in my face!
So now we pay up premiums on these swaps against housing market until the mortgages fail?
In other words,we loss millions money until someting that has never happened before happens?

A:That's correct.
