I've excerpted dialogue form _the Big Short_ as my homework of interpret.

Where I design 4 roles in this dialogue:

1. Boss of hedge fund (__Boss__ for short)
2. Product manager 1 of hedge fund(__A__ for short)
3. Product manager 2 of hedge fund(__B__ for short)
4. Product manager of bank (__Bank__ for short)

I believe that it's proper to set 4 roles in this dialogue.
Designing Boss of hedge fund and product manager of bank

>A:Through the nineteen thirties,the housing market collapsed nationwide.
By roughly 80 percent.
And half of all mortgage debt was in default.

>A:Boss,I have put out sth really interesting.

>Boss:Great! Whenever u find sth interesting,we all sit to make money.
What stock r u vowing?

>A:No,no,no,I want to short the housing market.

>Boss:really? but the housing market is rock-solid!
_Fed_ just said : "Bubbles r regional,defults r rare!"

>A:Look!He is wrong.

>Boss:Look,I don't think u mean to do this,but sometimes u sound very dismissive and superior.

>A: It's a fact,He is wrong.

>Boss:u r a great product manager.Why don't u just stick with stocks?

>A:u know me,I look for value,wherever it can be found.In fact,these mortgage backed securities r filled with extremely risky sub-prime adjustable rates.Once the majority of these adjustable rate kick in 2007.The American housing market is over.

>Boss:OK,just calm down!We'll talk about this later.

>A:C u.
