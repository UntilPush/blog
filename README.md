I've excerpted dialogue form _the Big Short_ as my homework of interpret.

Where I design 3 roles in this dialogue:

1. B of hedge fund (__B__ for short)
2. Product manager 1 of hedge fund(__A__ for short)
3. Product manager of bank (__C_ for short)

I believe that it's proper to set 3 roles in this dialogue.

#First

C: What is the basic of mortgage bond? The AAA-mortgages establish on Thousands
of B's and BBB's. If the lenders of BBB-mortgages couldn't repay,the price of 
house would fall.Then,lenders of AAA-mortgages wouldn't repay too.A lot of 
these bonds are going to zero.
And... This is an opportunity.

A:How can these underlying bonds be as bad as you say?

C:It's illegal!AAA-mortgages are made up of Thousands of BBB-mortgages without  
income-verification.We just repackage it,with a bunch of other shit that didn't sell.
and put it into a CDO.

A:A CDO?

C:YES

A:What is it ?

C:CDO,Collateralized Debt Obligations
Where we bundle B's BB's and BBB's that haven't sold in a pile.
When the pile gets large enough,the whole is suddenly considered 'Diversified'
Then,the rating agency give it AAA-rating.

A:So,BBB-mortgages are illegal,And AAA-mortgages are made up these shit?

A:So...you are offering us a chance to short American Housing market.
How to do this?

C:With something called a credit default swap.We can make a deal that 
it's like insurance on the bond,and if it goes bust,you can make 10-to-1.
Even 20-to-1 return,and it's already slowly going bust.

C:I'm standing in front of a burning house,and I'm offering you fire insurance 
on it.

A:Fine.We will take 130 million Garabaldi-4 BBB credit swap.

C:Sharpen your pencils,I'll get the paperwork ready.

A:Boss,I have put out something really interesting.

B:Great! Whenever you find something interesting,we all sit to make money.
What stock are you vowing?

A:No,no,no,I want to short the housing market.

B:Really? But the housing market is rock-solid!
_Greenspan_ just said : "Bubbles are regional,defults are rare!"

A:Look!He is wrong.

B:I don't think you mean to do this,but sometimes you sound very 
dismissive and superior.

A: It's a fact,He is wrong.

B:You are a great product manager.Why don't you just stick with stocks?

A:I look for value,wherever it can be found.In fact,the American housing 
market is going over.

B:OK,just calm down!How much in total?

A:130 million.

B:That's almost all of our fund liquidity!
That's highly distressing!

A:Well.I'm not certain that you really understand this trade.
I have full autonomy when it comes to investment strategy.
you can read our agreement.

B:Do not throw our acception-agreement in my face!
So now we pay up premiums on these swaps against housing market 
until the mortgages fail?In other words,we loss millions money until 
something that has never happened before happens?

A:That's correct.
